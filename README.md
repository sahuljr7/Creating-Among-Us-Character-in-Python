# Creating-Among-Us-Character-in-Python
This is a Python Code to create characters from Among Us. 
I have used Pycharm Community version 20.2. 
First you have to install a library in python by using the command pip install turtle. Otherwise it will show error for the code.
You can change the color of characters according to your desired colour i.e. BODY_COLOR = 'skyblue' for skyblue character,BODY_COLOR = 'red' for red character.
